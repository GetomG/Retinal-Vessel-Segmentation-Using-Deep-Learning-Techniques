# Retinal-Vessel-Segmentation-Using-Deep-Learning-Techniques
Biomedical Imaging and Analytics

This project explores and compares deep learning models for segmenting retinal blood vessels in fundus images using the DRIVE dataset. The goal is to improve diagnostic assistance in detecting retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and hypertension.

## Evaluation Metrics

We used the following metrics to evaluate model performance:

- **Accuracy**
- **F1 Score**
- **Jaccard Index (IoU)**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **Dice Coefficient**

## üß† Model Descriptions

- **U-Net**: A classic encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections, designed for biomedical image segmentation.
- **nnU-Net**: A robust, self-configuring version of U-Net that automatically adapts to any new biomedical dataset.
- **Swin UNet**: A hybrid model combining U-Net with Swin Transformer blocks, allowing hierarchical attention and better global context.
- **SAM (Segment Anything Model)**: A large-scale foundation model originally trained for general-purpose segmentation, adapted here for medical imaging.

## ‚ùó Limitations and Future Work

- **Small Dataset**: The DRIVE dataset contains only 40 images, limiting model generalization.
- **SAM Generalization Gap**: SAM performs well in generic tasks but requires adaptation for fine vessel structures.
- **Dataset Diversity**: Future work should evaluate models on datasets like CHASE_DB1 or STARE.
- **Hybrid Potential**: Combining transformer-based encoders with classic UNet-style decoders can yield strong results.
